The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century (around 1440) revolutionized the spread of knowledge in Europe. Before this, books were copied by hand, a slow and expensive process. Gutenberg's press, with its movable type, made it possible to produce books much more quickly and cheaply. This led to a massive increase in literacy, the wider dissemination of scientific and religious texts, and played a crucial role in the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation.

The moon landing, specifically Apollo 11, was a pivotal moment in human history. On July 20, 1969, American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon. Michael Collins piloted the command module in lunar orbit. This achievement was a culmination of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union and demonstrated immense technological and scientific advancement.

The fall of the Berlin Wall occurred on November 9, 1989. For nearly 30 years, the wall had physically and ideologically divided East and West Berlin, symbolizing the Cold War's Iron Curtain. Its collapse was a pivotal event that led to the reunification of Germany less than a year later and marked a significant step towards the end of the Cold War itself.
