Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind, such as learning and problem-solving. AI can be categorized into narrow AI (designed for specific tasks), general AI (human-level intelligence), and super AI (surpassing human intelligence). Machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision are key subsets of AI, driving innovations across various industries.

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and unchangeable ledger. It records transactions in "blocks" which are then linked together in a "chain" using cryptographic hashes. Once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered, making it highly secure and transparent. While commonly associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain technology has applications in supply chain management, healthcare records, voting systems, and intellectual property protection, offering enhanced security and traceability without central authority.

Cloud Computing involves delivering on-demand computing services—from applications to storage and processing power—over the internet ("the cloud") with pay-as-you-go pricing. It offers flexibility, scalability, and efficiency, allowing businesses and individuals to access resources without owning and maintaining physical data centers. Key service models include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
