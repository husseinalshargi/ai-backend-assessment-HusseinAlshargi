Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide on its surface. It is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. It has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. Scientists are particularly interested in Mars because of its potential for past or present life and the possibility of future human colonization.

Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. It is the fifth planet from the Sun. Jupiter is famous for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. It has 95 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which are significant in their own right. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our solar system. It is best known for its prominent ring system, which is made up of billions of small chunks of ice and rock. Saturn is also a gas giant, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has 146 known moons, with Titan being its largest and the second-largest moon in the Solar System.
