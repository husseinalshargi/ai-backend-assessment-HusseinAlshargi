        "question": "How can I prevent onions from making me cry when chopping them?",
        "answer": "To minimize tears when chopping onions, try chilling them in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes before cutting. You can also cut them under a running cold water tap, light a candle nearby, or wear protective eyewear like swimming goggles. Cutting with a very sharp knife also helps reduce cell damage, which releases fewer irritants."

        "question": "What's a simple way to check if an egg is fresh?",
        "answer": "To check if an egg is fresh, perform the float test. Gently place the egg in a bowl of cold water. If it sinks to the bottom and lies on its side, it's very fresh. If it stands on its end but still touches the bottom, it's still good but older. If it floats, it's likely spoiled due to a large air cell and should be discarded."

        "question": "How do I properly store fresh herbs to make them last longer?",
        "answer": "To extend the life of fresh herbs like parsley, cilantro, or basil, treat them like a bouquet of flowers. Trim the stems, place them in a glass or jar with an inch of water, and cover them loosely with a plastic bag. Store them in the refrigerator. Basil, however, prefers room temperature and should not be refrigerated, as cold can damage its leaves."

        "question": "What is the best way to ripen avocados quickly?",
        "answer": "To ripen avocados quickly, place them in a brown paper bag with a banana or an apple. These fruits release ethylene gas, a natural plant hormone that helps ripen other fruits. Close the bag loosely and leave it at room temperature. Check daily, and they should ripen in 1-3 days."
